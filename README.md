# Multi-LLM Agents with Crew.ai

## Running the Jupyter Notebooks

1. Navigate to a code lesson e.g. `L2`.
2. Create a python virtual environment (if it does not already exit)

    ```shell
    python3.12 -m venv .venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment

    ```shell
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file in the virtual environment.

    ```shell
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Launch the Jupyter Notebook

    ```shell
    python -m jupyter notebook
    ```
